#CONCLUSION

#In conclusion, the analysis of the FIFA 2022 dataset revealed the following insights:

#On average, both team1 and team2 had similar possession percentages. Possession in contest had a significant impact on the number of goals scored. Team1 and team2 had similar numbers of total attempts, on target attempts, and attempts inside the penalty area. The distribution of goals scored by team1 in the dataset was fairly evenly distributed. It can be inferred that possession and attempts are crucial factors in determining the number of goals scored in a match, however, it is not the only factor, other factors like team strategies, player skills, and luck also play a role.
